<p><em>Release Date: January 9, 2019</em></p>

<p><strong>PRINCE ALBERT, Saskatchewan</strong> – On the second anniversary of the passing of Ty Pozzobon, the Ty Pozzobon Foundation and Canadian Pro Rodeo Sports Medicine Team (CPRSMT) are proud to unveil the second in a series of educational videos. With the first video focusing on concussion awareness, the latest video more broadly addresses the importance of mental health.</p>

<p>“We are proud of the 50,000+ views of the first video which addressed concussions,” said Ty Pozzobon Foundation President Tanner Byrne. “We saw mental health as the next step in the continuation of educating those involved in western sports.”</p>

<p>Three-time Canadian Champion bareback rider Jake Vold, 2013 Canadian Champion bareback rider Matt Lait, 2003 Canadian Champion Bull Rider Jody Turner and Heard Wellness through Horses’ Amy Monea highlight the list of expert commentators featured in the second video.</p>

<p>Fully funded by the Ty Pozzobon Foundation, the latest piece also features insight from psychologist Ann Pierzchalski.</p>

<p>“The central theme of this video from the contestant perspective is that, ‘it’s okay to say I’m not okay,’” Brandon Thome, Vice President of the CPRSMT said. “Our hope in this second video is that contestants continue to share when they realize that they aren’t OK. We want there to be a realization that there is help out there. We also hope those involved in western sport continue to learn more to take further care of themselves.”</p>
