**CALGARY, Alberta** – Two years after the passing of Ty Pozzobon, the Ty Pozzobon Foundation is proud to announce official registered charity status in Canada.

The official designation allows the Foundation to accept larger donations and provide tax receipts to donors from this date forward. No receipts will be provided for donations that have already been made in the past.

“This status is what we have been after for the past 24 months since Ty’s passing,” said Tanner Byrne, Ty Pozzobon Foundation President. “By now being recognized officially as a charity, we can really open the doors to helping protect the health and well-being of western sports participants inside and outside the arena.”

In addition to the two educational videos that have already been made, the Ty Pozzobon Foundation looks to continue their support in western sport.

“This isn’t only big news for the Ty Pozzobon Foundation but the Canadian Pro Rodeo Sports Medicine Team (CPRSMT) as well,” said Brandon Thome, CPRSMT Vice President. “With the support of the Ty Pozzobon Foundation, our footprint more than doubled in one year. This designation and the support of corporate donations will help grow the CPRSMT even futher.”

Since it’s founding in Feb. 2018, the Ty Pozzobon Foundation has raised more than \$250,000 to support and protect the health and well-being of western sports participants inside and outside the arena.
