<p>“This isn’t only big news for the Ty Pozzobon Foundation but the Canadian Pro Rodeo Sports Medicine Team (CPRSMT) as well,” said Brandon Thome, CPRSMT Vice President. “With the support of the Ty Pozzobon Foundation, our footprint more than doubled in one year. This designation and the support of corporate donations will help grow the CPRSMT even futher.”</p>

<p>Since it’s founding in Feb. 2018, the Ty Pozzobon Foundation has raised more than \$250,000 to support and protect the health and well-being of western sports participants inside and outside the arena.</p>
